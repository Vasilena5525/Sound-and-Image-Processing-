This is Vasilena Stamova's portfolio of work including 5 small p5.js sketches 

# Project 1 - Mosaic
P5 link: https://editor.p5js.org/vasilenastmv/present/-XaLf2xty

This is a type of filter in image processing. In my sketch I have shown an animation of different pixel densities of the same image which are formed into a blurred mosaic.

# Project 2 - Particle systems
P5 link: https://editor.p5js.org/vasilenastmv/present/pDLci0qpe

This sketch represents a particle system where all the particles are connected depending on the distance between each one.

# Project 3 - Recursion
P5 link: https://editor.p5js.org/vasilenastmv/present/LAhh8pEWN

This is an interactive sketch which shows all the stages of recursion. When you move the slider to the right you can see a single square, when you start moving it towards the left side, you can see the recursion process as the number of squares increases.

# Project 4 - Trigonometry (sin & cos)
P5 link: https://editor.p5js.org/vasilenastmv/present/BFqkonmqh

This is another interactive sketch with trigonometric wave represented through text. When you point your mouse towards the text you can see how the wave changes. I have also used rotating sin and cos circles to form a halo on top of the text.

# Project 5 - Generative images using pixels
P5 link: https://editor.p5js.org/vasilenastmv/present/8yiVjxVhY

In this sketch I have pixelated an image by breaking it down into small black and white rectangles by remapping the values from one range to another.
